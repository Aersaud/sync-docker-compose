Docker compose for sync by calzoneman

Clone the repo, edit the config file with your information. Make sure the docker-compose file matches your config where needed (port numbers, passwords, certs)

Uncomment the reverse proxy section in the docker-compose.yml if you plan on using a reverse proxy and make sure you edit the name to match your proxy network.
